Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.
Note that only one type of a given movie is supported. If you want both a 4k version and 1080p version of a given movie you will need multiple instances.

*Important* Make sure you disable automatic updates to prevent installing the normal Radarr versions!

Radar-AirDCPP adds airdcpp-web as both an indexer and download client. You can keep the original release dirs by using the symlink support added to this fork in combination with rar2fs. Setup a "Remove Path Mapping" on the Settings -> Download Clients page with your AirDCPP download dir (the same as you use in the Download Client config) as the Remote Path and the rar2fs mount that contains the extracted movies as your Local Path. This will create a symlink in the Radarr movie dirs linking to the rar2fs movie. The movie API endpoint has also been updated to add symlink support, which provides compatibility with Bazarr.

## Example config:

Default download directory in AirDCPP: /mnt/movies/

RAR2FS mount, containing the (virtually) extracted content of /mnt/movies: /mnt/plex/movies

First enable experimental symlink support under Media Management (advanced settings) (no automatic upgrades for now if you use this option):

This option, in combination with a rar2fs mount, will allow you to keep your original release files/rars. It will import the movie to the Radarr movie dir and create a symlink linking to the rar2fs movie. With the example config, your movie would be downloaded to /mnt/movies/Sample.Movie.2018.1080p.Bluray-GROUP and the rar2fs mount /mnt/plex/movies/Sample.Movie.2018.1080p.Bluray-GROUP would show the extracted content. Radarr-AirDCPP will create a symlink to the movie file, not touching your original files.
